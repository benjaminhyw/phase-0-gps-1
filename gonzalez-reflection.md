# GPS 1.1 - Version Control and Git (short - medium) - Carlos Gonzalez

**What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**
- the merging is very scary for me i always fear to delete the project, and in other approaches with git i had a lot of problems merging branches.

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
- Fetch and Merge, prior to the GPS i only knew pull which is like a fetch+merge combination, so it was good to get that clear.

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
- Exactly that, what was the difference between fetch+merge and pull

**What still confuses you about git?**
- I'm having problems with the markdown in git, and i'll read about further stuff.

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
- It was really cool, i felt a little lost at the beginning, but with the help of Ben and Caitlyn, i could catch up.
