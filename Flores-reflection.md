What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I was struggling with git pull and git merge.  I understood conceptually but had a hard time actually executing those commands.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
git pull and git merge were clarified tho I still feel like I need more practice.  I also learned a couple of tricks from my pair Carlos!

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I feel like I asked a lot of clarifying questions as I was driving.  I realized that my steps maybe don't go in order so I would ask to check and see that I as moving in the right direction.  I asked for clarification on the pull/merge.  I also asked my pair how he went about steps, to see what similarites/ differences we had in our style.

What still confuses you about git?
I think I understand most of Git I just need practice to lock it down.  I need to learn more of the shortcut commands and play around with moving/renaming, etc.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was awesome!  Carlos was an excellent pair and Caitlyn was a great guide.  I felt confused throughout several parts of the GPS but both of them were very friendly and resourceful, i felt comfortable in my confusion :]
